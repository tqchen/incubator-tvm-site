\subsection{Detailed Description}
Definitions and helper macros for I\+R/\+A\+ST nodes. 

The node folder contains base utilities for I\+R/\+A\+ST nodes, invariant of which specific language dialect.

We implement A\+S\+T/\+IR nodes as sub-\/classes of runtime\+::\+Object. The base class Node is just an alias of runtime\+::\+Object.

Besides the runtime type checking provided by Object, node folder contains additional functionalities such as reflection and serialization, which are important features for building a compiler infra.
